Translating all the algorithms from Github Repo https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python to OCaml (Practice)

Maybe later down the line also tests for the algorithms.

Also trying to be as functional as possible as well as aiming for tail recursion... ...

ANYTHING related to reading in files: image/sound/video will not be part of this repo  for the time being.
Meaning: Naturally, some algorithms will be missing since setting up while staying purely functional/mathematical
         is simply out of scope - will maybe follow later down the line.
