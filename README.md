# Algorithms implemented in C++ Translation to OCaml Functional & Tail-Recursive
Translating some of the algorithms from Github Repo https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/C-Plus-Plus to OCaml
Just for pure practice.

Maybe later down the line also tests for the algorithms.
Trying to stay functional.

ANYTHING related to reading in files or  managing ressources in general: 
image/sound/video will not be part of this repo  for the time being.
Meaning: Naturally, some algorithms will be missing since setting up while staying purely functional/mathematical 
is simply out of scope - will maybe follow later down the line.
